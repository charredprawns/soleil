This is a sample project that works on the MERN stack. It utilizes a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database connection to serve information through a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend to a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) front end.

This portion of the code is a React.js front end. I have opted to use [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) for most of the basic components.
