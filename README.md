This codebaseis essentially a React.js front end. I have constructed this project through using a basic [CRA shell](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and using [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for the routing. I have opted to use [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) for most of the basic components.


Throughout, you'll find small projects that I found fun or enjoyable to create. They test different idea's I have had, and also display different methods of descision making when coding. For example, on the [Mobile Move page](https://hardcore-leakey-df9cd2.netlify.com/move), I decided to use Material-ui's media query for mobile responsivity, and elsewhere I have used a different convention 


*Mongo Project* :

This is a sample project that works on the MERN stack. It utilizes a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database connection to serve information through a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend to a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) front end.
